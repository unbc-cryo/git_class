    "Putting your manuscripts and other text-based files under Git can be rewarding, as long as you take some considerations into account. While Git can track any file that you instruct it to, with some file formats you are not getting the most out of Git. An example that is relevant to many academics is Microsoft Word’s native file format, DOCX. Since a DOCX file is a compressed XML file, diffing a DOCX file is not very informative.\n",

    "You should make it a habit of ignoring large non-text files in your repository, which GitHub is not suited for (and may be too large to store for free anyway). You can ignore files and folders by including them in a text file called `.gitignore`. To associate ignored files with your project when you want to share it, you can include code to download these files from another storage location, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Zenodo allows you to associate files with a DOI, which makes sharing easier.\n",
